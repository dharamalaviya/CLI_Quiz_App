        d : "Andrea Ferro",

        note : "In the year 1970, Alan Kay gave Object-Oriented programming. He coined the concept of OOPS at a grad school in the year 1966 or 1967. Alan kay, Adele Goldberg, Dan Ingalls and others developed the first Smalltalk programming language, which follows the OOPS concept."

        d : "Polymorphism",
        ans : "a",
        note : "Inheritance is an important OOPS feature which derives the class from the base class or superclass. This OOPS feature inherits the features of another class in the programs. This mechanism actually inherits the fields and methods of the superclass."

        c : "Java",
        d : "C++",
        ans : "c",
        note : "Java is a programming language that disapproves of the concept of 'multiple inheritance'. So, it does not agree with all types of inheritance. But, we can implement 'multiple inheritance' in Java language using the interface concept."
